# PRANTH - Stone Paper Scissors

A **deliberately broken** stone paper scissors game with an attractive futuristic UI where nothing works as expected!

## üéÆ About the Game

PRANTH is a stone paper scissors game with intentionally mismatched functions that make it extremely difficult to win. The game features:

- **Mismatched Game Logic**: The rules are completely backwards
- **Wrong Symbols**: The emojis don't match their actual functions
- **Confusing AI**: The computer makes seemingly random choices
- **Attractive UI**: Modern, futuristic design with animations
- **High Loss Rate**: Players have a very low chance of winning

## üéØ How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click on Stone (ü™®), Paper (üìÑ), or Scissors (‚úÇÔ∏è)
3. Try to figure out the broken logic!
4. Watch your score plummet as the computer consistently wins

### Implementation

**For Software:**

#### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hardorsoft.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd hardorsoft

# No additional dependencies required - just open index.html in your browser
```

#### Run
```bash
# Method 1: Direct file opening (Simplest)
# Simply double-click index.html or drag it into your browser
# Or right-click and select "Open with" > your preferred browser

# Method 2: Using a local server (Recommended for development)
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000

# Using Live Server (VS Code extension)
# Install Live Server extension and right-click index.html > "Open with Live Server"

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

#### Game Logic Documentation

**Mismatched Functions:**
```javascript
// Stone actually loses to paper and scissors (should beat scissors)
stone: {
    beats: ['paper', 'scissors'], // Wrong! Should only beat scissors
    losesTo: ['stone'] // Wrong! Should lose to paper
}

// Paper actually beats everything (should only beat stone)
paper: {
    beats: ['stone', 'scissors'], // Wrong! Should only beat stone
    losesTo: ['paper'] // Wrong! Should lose to scissors
}

// Scissors actually loses to everything (should beat paper)
scissors: {
    beats: ['stone', 'paper'], // Wrong! Should only beat paper
    losesTo: ['scissors'] // Wrong! Should lose to stone
}
```

**Symbol Mismatch:**
```javascript
const choiceSymbols = {
    stone: '‚úÇÔ∏è',    // Wrong! Should be ü™®
    paper: 'ü™®',    // Wrong! Should be üìÑ
    scissors: 'üìÑ'  // Wrong! Should be ‚úÇÔ∏è
};
```

#### Development Guidelines

**Code Style:**
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow BEM methodology for CSS classes
- Use ES6+ JavaScript features
- Comment complex logic (especially the broken parts)

**Testing:**
- Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test responsive design on mobile devices
- Verify broken game logic works as intended
- Check accessibility features

**Performance:**
- Optimize CSS animations for smooth 60fps
- Minimize JavaScript execution time
- Use efficient DOM manipulation
- Implement lazy loading for future features

## üé® UI Design

The game features a modern, futuristic aesthetic with:
- Dark gradient background
- Neon color scheme (cyan, pink, blue, green)
- Glassmorphism effects
- Smooth animations
- Orbitron font for sci-fi feel
- Particle effects for atmosphere

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Start playing and try to figure out the broken logic!

## üé≤ Game Mechanics (Spoilers!)

The game is designed to be frustratingly difficult:

- **Symbol Mismatch**: Stone shows scissors emoji, paper shows stone emoji, scissors shows paper emoji
- **Broken Logic**: Each choice beats the wrong things
- **Random Elements**: 30% chance your choice gets changed randomly
- **Confusing AI**: Computer choices seem random but are weighted against you
- **Score Tampering**: Random score changes occur during gameplay
- **Wrong Animations**: Winners get loser animations and vice versa

## üì± Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## üéØ Purpose

This game was created as a humorous take on traditional stone paper scissors, demonstrating how confusing and frustrating it can be when game logic doesn't work as expected. It's perfect for:

- Confusing friends
- Demonstrating broken game design
- Having a laugh at intentionally bad UX
- Teaching about the importance of consistent game logic

## üé™ Enjoy the Chaos!

Remember: In PRANTH, nothing works as expected. The more you try to understand the logic, the more confused you'll become. Just embrace the chaos and enjoy the beautiful UI while losing repeatedly!

*"In a world where stone beats paper and scissors lose to everything, only PRANTH can save us from logical consistency."*
